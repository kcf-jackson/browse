Title: A file browser for RStudio
Version: 0.5.0
Author: Chun Fung (Jackson) Kwok
Maintainer: Chun Fung (Jackson) Kwok <kcf.jackson@gmail.com>
Description: Implements a file browser within RStudio using `finder.js` 
    which supports multi-column view. A key feature of the package is 
    that it supports re-mapping of the files without changing the 
    directory structure. This allows us to effectively create 
    subdirectories within the R package folder, and more generally close 
    the gap between the mental space (how we think about the files) 
    and the workspace (how the files are organised).
